			<h3 style="color: red;">Email Fraud Warning!</h3>
			<p>We would like to alert all of our clients about a new internet fraud scheme that is causing a number of unsuspecting <strong><u>home buyers to lose their down payments</u></strong>. Please read this alert in full so that you will not become a victim of this fraudulent activity.</p>

			<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates that more than $3.1 billion dollars has been stolen from victims of wire fraud schemes. The number of fraudulent wire transfer scams reported by title companies and closing agents to the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center increased by 480 percent in 2016. This type of fraud was reported in all 50 states.</p>

			<p>As a precaution, follow the suggestions below to make sure you protect yourself from fraud:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>DO NOT wire money based on an email.</li>
				<li>Beware of any modification or change to wire instructions.</li>
				<li>VERIFY all instructions by phone.</li>
				<li>DO NOT use the phone number in an email.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Heritage Title, LTD will NOT change our wiring instructions via email. If you receive an e-mail that purports to be from our office indicating that our wiring instructions have changed and/or instructing you to wire funds elsewhere, please CALL our office immediately. Heritage Title uses a single wire account for ALL transactions. The account will not change.</p>

			<p>More information about the wire fraud scheme can be read at the <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/newsroom/ncua-report/2018/wire-transfer-scams-involving-real-estate-transactions-are-increasing" target="_blank">National Credit Union Administration website</a>.</p>
